## Contents
- Machine Learning
  - [Heart Disease Prediction Modeling](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Heart_Disease_Prediction_Modeling.ipynb): Predicting heart disease in patients using a complilation of machine learning classification models, with transformation of data using Standard Scalars and a K-Nearest Neighbors function for imputing missing data into the dataset. Evaluation of models demonstrating confusion matrices and AUC.
  - [Housing Price Prediction Modeling](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Housing_Price_Prediction_Modeling.ipynb): Experimenting with various machine learning regression models using block level housing prices from the 1990 California Census, and evaluating the best model. Uses a variety of reusable production ready functions to transform the dataset and evaluate the models for efficacy, including cross validation.

- Data Analysis and Visualization
  - [Paragliding IGC File Transformation and Visualization](https://nbviewer.org/github/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Paragliding_IGC_Decoder.ipynb): A from scratch project to decode and trasnform IGC flight files in order to obtain flat file formatted data in Pandas, with subsequent analysis and identification of efficient gliding methods and local thermal insights.
  - [SQL DB Insertion with Python](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/SQL_DB_Insertion_With_Python.py): A setup of SQLite3 on my local machine with insertion of new tables and records into the database from different file formats contained in a single folder. Offers direct file insertion or batch file insertion utilizing the Glob package.
  - [Stock Market EDA and Feature Generation](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/StockMarket_EDA%2BFeature_Generation.ipynb): A primer on algorithmic trading and feature engineering of daily stock price data using TQQQ, including a simple moving average (Mean Reversion) trading strategy with subsequent backtest of trade signals, outputting key performance metrics to inform personal trading.

- NLP
  - [Word Cloud](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Word_Clouding.ipynb): Creating a simple word cloud and adding some flare by fitting the world cloud to a background image

  - [SQL Template for Google Sheets Insertion](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Template_SQL_GSheets_Automation.py): A handy template I have used for automation in many aspects to Google's API client with Python package PyGsheets for placing the output of SQL queries into a Google sheet, along with sheet formatting examples and workbook sharing via email.
  - [Excel Folder Search Tool](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Excel_Folder_Search_Tool.py): Searches all like-kind file types within a folder and returns lines/rows into a new DataFrame/Excel with the matched line or row and location of the matched data.
  - [Excel File Consolidation Tool](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Excel_File_Consolidation_Tool.py): Takes many excel files into one within a single folder. A useful tool for consolidation of weekly reporting that is generated with similar column headers daily, weekly, or monthly.
  - [3D Plotly Modeling](https://github.com/HypnoticRegression/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/3D_Plotly_Modeling.ipynb): An example of a 3D interactive chart in Plotly using Federal Reserve Federal Funding Rates over time.
