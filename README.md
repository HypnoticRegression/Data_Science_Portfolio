#Data Science Portfolio

Hi, my name is Blayne and I work as a strategist and data analyst/scientist. I hold a dual Bachelor's in Human Resource Management and Business Management, and a Master's in Business Administration from the University of Colorado.

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. Whether the puzzle at hand is helping entrepreneurs get their business up and running/running more efficiently, extracting insights from large datasets, visualizing data, or helping an organization extract actionable insights from their data, I am always up for solving the problems that result in organizational growth, increase domain knowledge, and reduce cost.

This is a repository containing a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for template storage, self-learning, and hobby purposes.
